üèéÔ∏è Educational Speed Robot

An educational robot that helps K-12 students visualize speed and motion concepts through Bluetooth-controlled demonstrations.
Developed as part of the Senior Design Project (Class of 2025) in Computer Engineering at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

üöÄ Overview

The Educational Speed Robot is an autonomous line-following vehicle designed to teach embedded control systems concepts such as:

Feedback control using PID algorithms

Sensor integration (reflectance, encoder feedback)

PWM-based motor control and tuning

Bluetooth telemetry and mobile control interfaces

The project integrates hardware, firmware, and a mobile app to create a modular educational platform for real-time control system experiments.
